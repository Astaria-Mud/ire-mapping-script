# IRE Mapping Script

This script allows [Mudlet's](http://www.mudlet.org) mapper to do autowalking on Achaea, Aetolia, Lusternia, Imperian, or Midkemia Online. See the [download section](http://wiki.mudlet.org/w/IRE_mapping_script#Download) to get started!

It has many features such as:

The script is written and maintained by Vadi, with Qwindor doing the notable mapping in Achaea.

To contact Qwindor about adjustments that need to be made to the Achaean crowdmap you can contact him in game or on skype at "qwindor.rousseau". Please include room numbers if possible to make it easier and faster for the corrections to be made.
